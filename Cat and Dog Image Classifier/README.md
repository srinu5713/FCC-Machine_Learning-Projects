# Cats and Dogs Image Classification Project

This project involves creating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. You will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to achieve this. The goal is to classify images with at least 63% accuracy, with extra credit for achieving 70% accuracy.

## Project Structure

The structure of the dataset files that are downloaded looks like this (You will notice that the test directory has no subdirectories and the images are not labelled):
```
cats_and_dogs
|__ train:
    |______ cats: [cat.0.jpg, cat.1.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.0.jpg, dog.1.jpg ...]
|__ validation:
    |______ cats: [cat.2000.jpg, cat.2001.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.2000.jpg, dog.2001.jpg ...]
|__ test: [1.jpg, 2.jpg ...]
```
